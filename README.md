# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is meant to analyze PyBer data in order to show trends across three different city types: Urban, Rural, Urban, and Suburban. We are aiming to obtain two things for our analysis:
1. The first is a dataframe summarizing the total rides, drivers and fares, as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver across the city types.
2. A graph representing the total fare by city type across the first 4 months of 2019 in order to visualize trends.

#### Overview of Summary Dataframe Results

In this table we can see the disparity of usability for PyBer across the city types. Paying special attention to rural city types we can see that they have far less rides, drivers, and fares. We can see that suburban cities have 5 times more rides than rural cities, and urban cities have 13 times more rides that rural cities. Suburban cities have around 6 times more drivers than rural cities, and urban cities have around 31 times more drivers that rural cities. Suburban cities have around 4 times more in total fares than rural cities, and urban cities have 9 times more in total fares than rural cities. We can also see that the average fare per ride for the rural cities are higher than both suburban and urban cities, and such is the case with the average fare per driver.

This graph visually displays the disparities between the cities across the first 4 months of 2019. Here it is obvious that the rural cities are making way less than the other cities.

## Summary of Analysis

Three things that PyBer to increase Rural Riders and Drivers are:
1. Offer incentives for rural riders to use the app, like discounts if they are going to or from rural cities
2. Offer incentives for rural drivers to use the app more, like bonuses if they are going to or from rural cities
3. Decrease the price of a PyBer ride in the rural cities so more riders will use them.
